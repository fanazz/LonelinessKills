Even if it's a utopic idea, this page's creator thinks that people still care about strangers. Still could find some tolerance, warmth, and acceptance in their heart and could try to offer themselves for others. This page idea is to connect people who don't have anything and feel abandoned with people who have enough empathy to understand their situation and could offer their free time for others. THIS IS NOT A DATING APP!!!" %}<br/>
